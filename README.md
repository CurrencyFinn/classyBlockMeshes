## Multi-Cylinder CFD Mesh Example
A straightforward [classy_blocks](https://github.com/damogranlabs/classy_blocks) example for generating a mesh with multiple cylinders, suitable for CFD simulations. This setup is ideal for applications such as:

- Tubular reactors or heat exchangers
- Flow through tube bundles
- Flow around fibers or packed cylinders

The repository demonstrates how to create and arrange multiple cylindrical blocks, exporting a blockMeshDict ready for OpenFOAM.
